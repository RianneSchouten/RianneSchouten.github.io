### Introduction and affiliations

My name is Rianne Schouten and I am an enthusiast about data: datawarehousing, SQL, nice visualisations, statistical techniques, R and mostly: missing data. During a Master's in Methodology and Statistics, I co-developed a procedure to generate mising data in complete datasets. I implemented the procedure in R-function `ampute`, and it is now part of R-package `mice`.

In 2017, I continued my thesis research as an external researcher under supervision of [dr. Gerko Vink](https://www.gerkovink.com) and [prof. dr. Stef van Buuren](https://github.com/stefvanbuuren). I focused on [The evaluation of missing data methodologies](pdfs/ResearchProposal_RianneSchouten.pdf) and investigated the effect of missing data on prediction oriented analyses. In May 2019, I stopped with my research as it was no longer feasible to combine a job and research.

At Samen Veilig Midden-Nederland (i.e. a youth care organization), I have a position as Developer Data & Analytics. It is my job to structure and standardize the analyses of sensitive and highly classified data. On the one hand I take an active part in writing the SQL queries and performing the calculations in R, Logi Analytics and Power BI. On the other hand, I oversee the system requirements and allocate work to other developers and stakeholders.

As a person, I have an open and direct personality and am always eager to learn. Especially about nice applications of (missing) data analysis.

### Software development

#### 1. `ampute` in R-package **mice**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
require(mice)
?ampute
```

R-function `ampute` is the implementation of a [multivariate amputation procedure](pdfs/ArticleAmpute.pdf). With `ampute`, it is straightforward to generate missing values in multiple variables, with different missing data proportions and varying underlying missingness mechanisms. An extensive [vignette](https://rianneschouten.github.io/mice_ampute/vignette/ampute.html) is available.

#### 2. `parlMICE` 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
require(devtools)
source_url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RianneSchouten/parlMICE/master/parlMICE.R')
```

With large datasets or with higher number of imputations, performing multiple imputation with `mice` in R-package **mice** might take a long time. As a solution, Gerko Vink and I created wrapper function `parlMICE`. With `parlMICE`, the imputation procedure can be run in parallel. Find all information [in the github repo](https://github.com/RianneSchouten/parlMICE) or read the [vignette](https://www.gerkovink.com/parlMICE/Vignette_parlMICE.html) to know when to use `parlMICE`.

#### 3. `pymice`: `mice` in Python

Although many missing data functions exist in `R`, the collection of missing data functions in `Python` is quite poor. I created the start of a new package which will eventually consist of three parts: missing data exploration, multivariate amputation and multiple imputation. 

At the moment, the package contains class `McarTests`, which consists of two functions to inspect whether the nonresponse has a MCAR missingness mechanism. Little's MCAR test is implemented in `mcar_test` and for each pair of variables, t-tests can be performed with function `mcar_t_tests`. The code can be found in my Github repository called [`pymice`](https://github.com/RianneSchouten/pymice).

The next release of scikit-learn will contain an Iterative Imputer, developed
by Sergey Feldman. Although the IterativeImputer performs single imputation
by default, I wrote an example that shows how to use the imputer to perform
multiple imputation. The example will be in the next release.

### Presentations

- **UPCOMING!!**: R-Ladies Amsterdam, 2nd October 2019

[Sign up here!](https://www.meetup.com/nl-NL/rladies-amsterdam/events/264758006/)

**Description**: When you work with data, it is most likely you will encounter missing data. Especially in application-oriented fields, available datasets are almost always incomplete. As most analyses require complete data, what to do with the missing values?

An often used and easy solution to handle missing data is deleting incomplete rows and/or columns from the dataset. Is this method the most appropriate one, though? What other methods are available and what is their influence on the outcome of the analysis?

The workshop has the following three parts. 

1.	Missing Values Analysis

What amount and what kind of missing data do I have in my dataset? What are possible reasons/mechanisms underlying the missingness? 

2.	Evaluating Missing Data methods

How do I know whether I choose the right  missing data method? What should I take into account when deciding about a missing data method? 

3.	Implementing Missing Data Methods

How can I implement missing data methods in my analysis and/or in my pipeline?
