### Introduction and affiliations

My name is Rianne and I develop data analysis methods.

I am a PhD Candidate at Eindhoven University of Technology and study the Exceptional Model Mining framework. We work on developing solutions for heterogeneous datasets with time-dependent attributes. My supervisors are [dr. Wouter Duivesteijn](http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/~wouter/) and [prof. Mykola Pechenizkiy](https://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/). 

Additionally, I work on Missing Data methods, particularly the process of generating missing values in complete datasets. Under supervision of [prof. Stef van Buuren](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=_3y5C0UAAAAJ&hl=nl) and [dr. Gerko Vink](https://www.gerkovink.com/), I developed a multivariate amputation procedure and implemented the method in an R-function ([`ampute`](https://rianneschouten.github.io/mice_ampute/vignette/ampute.html) in package [`mice`](https://github.com/stefvanbuuren/mice)) and python module ([`pyampute`](https://rianneschouten.github.io/pyampute/build/html/index.html)).

I find it important that my work can be used for real-world problems (e.g. in health care) and enjoy collaborating on projects. Please contact me if you have questions or seek opportunities to work together.

### Software development

#### 1. `ampute` in R-package **mice**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(mice)
?ampute
```

R-function `ampute` is the implementation of a multivariate amputation procedure: a method for generating missing data in complete datasets. With `ampute`, it is straightforward to generate missing values in multiple variables, with different missing data proportions and varying underlying missingness mechanisms. Read [the article](pdfs/ArticleAmpute.pdf) or [the vignette](https://rianneschouten.github.io/mice_ampute/vignette/ampute.html) to learn more.

#### 2. `parlMICE` 

For large datasets or when you want to impute with a large number of imputations, multiple imputation with `mice` in R-package **mice** may have a long run time. As a solution, Gerko Vink and I created wrapper function `parlMICE`, which allows for a parallel run of `mice`.

The function is now part of package **mice** under the name `parlmice`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(mice)
?parlmice
```

All information can be found [in the github repo](https://github.com/RianneSchouten/parlMICE) or in the [vignette](https://www.gerkovink.com/parlMICE/Vignette_parlMICE.html).

#### 3. `pyampute`: the first Python library for data amputation

Library `pyampute` provides the multivariate amputation methodology to the Python community, and it does more. It has improved default settings, allows for a combined MAR+MNAR mechanism, for custom probability functions and since it is compatible with scikit-learn's `fit` and `transform` paradigm, seamless integration in data processing pipelines becomes easy. 

Find plenty of examples in [`pyampute`'s documentation](https://rianneschouten.github.io/pyampute/build/html/index.html). Davina's presentation at SciPy22 can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI0gx52ucMA&t=25560s).

Install using pip or from source:

```
pip install pyampute
```

```
git clone https://github.com/RianneSchouten/pyampute.git
pip install ./pyampute
```

### Personal development

To develop myself as a teacher, I am participating in the University Teaching Qualification (UTQ) Training Program.

Other courses that I participated in are Project management (PROOF TU/e 2020), Introduction to Process Mining (Fluxicon, 2020), Learning and Reasoning (SIKS, 2021) and Communication Styles (PROOF TU/e 2021).
